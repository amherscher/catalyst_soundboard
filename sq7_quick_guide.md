# 🎚️ Quick Guide to the Allen & Heath SQ-7

## 1. Getting Comfortable with the Board
- The SQ-7 is a **digital mixer**: every fader, knob, and button can control different things depending on which **layer** or **mix** you are on.
- Think of it like pages on a tablet: you “flip pages” (layers) to control different channels.

---

## 2. Layers: Switching Between Channel Groups
- The **Layer buttons** (A, B, C, etc.) change what the faders control.
  - **Layer A**: Usually your main input channels (mics, instruments).
  - **Layer B/C**: Often assigned to effects, outputs, or special channels.
- To change: just press the button for the layer you want. The screen and colored lights help you see where you are.

👉 **Tip:** If you move a fader and it doesn’t change the sound you expected, you’re probably on the wrong layer.

## 3. Mixes: Controlling Monitor Sends
- Each musician or speaker may have their own **monitor mix**.
- Press the **Mix button** above a fader bank:
  - The faders now show how much of each channel is being sent to that monitor (instead of controlling the main output).
  - Example: If you press “Mix 1,” the faders now control what’s going to Monitor 1.
- Press **LR (Main Mix)** to go back to controlling the main front speakers.

👉 **Tip:** Always double-check which mix you’re in before moving faders.

## 4. EQ Basics (Shaping the Sound)
- Select a channel by pressing its **Select button**.
- The touchscreen shows that channel’s EQ.
- Use the **rotary knobs under the screen** to adjust:
  - **Highs (Treble):** Brightness and clarity. Turn down if harsh, up if dull.
  - **Mids:** Where most “character” of voices and instruments live. Sweep the frequency to find trouble spots, then cut or boost gently.
  - **Lows (Bass):** Fullness and boom. Reduce if it sounds muddy, add if it’s thin.

👉 **Rule of Thumb:** Cut before boosting. Small adjustments (1–3 dB) often make a big difference.

---

## 5. High-Pass Filter (HPF)
- Found in the EQ section.
- Rolls off unwanted low “rumble” (like footsteps or handling noise).
- For vocals: set around **80–120 Hz**.
- For instruments: depends, but use it whenever you don’t need deep bass.

## 6. Quick Workflow Example
1. **Check your layer** (Layer A for input channels).
2. **Select the channel** you want (e.g., Vocal Mic).
3. On the screen:
   - Turn on the **High-Pass Filter**.
   - Adjust EQ: clean up mud, brighten if needed.
4. **Switch to the musician’s mix** (e.g., Mix 2) and adjust their monitor.
5. Press **LR** to return to the main speakers.

---

## 7. Tips for Success
- **Stay calm:** The board looks intimidating, but layers keep it organized.
- **Label channels:** Use tape or the touchscreen scribble strip so you always know what’s what.
- **Small moves:** Don’t over-EQ or push faders drastically—gentle changes go far.
- **Return to LR:** After adjusting a monitor mix, always go back to LR to avoid confusion.

✅ With this guide, you’ll be able to:
- Move between **layers** to access different controls.
- Adjust **mixes** for monitors.
- Apply basic **EQ** for clarity and balance.
